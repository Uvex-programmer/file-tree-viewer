# file-tree-viewer

This is a small application that will visualise a file tree, based on an array of strings.
Array looking like this : [
  "marvel/black_widow/bw.png",
  "marvel/drdoom/the-doctor.png",
  "fact_marvel_beats_dc.txt",
  "dc/aquaman/mmmmmomoa.png",
  "marvel/black_widow/why-the-widow-is-awesome.txt",
  "dc/aquaman/movie-review-collection.txt",
  "marvel/marvel_logo.png",
  "dc/character_list.txt"
]

You can add/delete/rename folders and files by right clicking on the targeted file/folder.
